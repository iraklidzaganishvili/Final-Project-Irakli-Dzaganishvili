# Final-Project-Irakli-Dzaganishvili
This is a final project for TBC

I was allowed to make a website about my projects which I think would be more useful and interesting for me than a website about some actor, for example that none will use anyways.

I will follow this prompt but might change some things I don't like: https://www.figma.com/file/S7wePJxWbUjRm9aVv0bdfn/Agriculture-Webflow-Website-Template-(Community)?node-id=2%3A14655&mode=dev

I will also use Bootstrap for one element (the navbar) and scss for everything else.
